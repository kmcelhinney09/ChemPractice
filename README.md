# Chemistry Concepts Auto Generation Quiz

This is my second phase project for flatiron schools. It is a single page react application that uses materialUI for stylizing. The application auto generates a quiz based off of quesiton type selection (prediting bond type, metal vs nonmetal elements, electronegativity difference calculations) and the number of questions (1-100). The applicaiton utilize a json-server database for element data, quesiton type data, and high score tracking. 

## Installation

This project utilizes Node.js, React(https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html), React-Router-Dom(https://v5.reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start), and MaterialUI(https://mui.com/) all using npm(https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) for package instillation

## Usage

This applicaiton was desgined to be used in my (and others) chemistry classes to all students to create practice quizes for some of the hardest compcepts in my introductory high school chemistry classes.
